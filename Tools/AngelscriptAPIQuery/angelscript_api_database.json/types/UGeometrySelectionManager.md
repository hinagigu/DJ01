# UGeometrySelectionManager

**继承自**: `UObject`

UGeometrySelectionManager provides the infrastructure for "Element Selection", ie
geometric sub-elements of some geometry object like a Triangle Mesh. The Manager is
designed to work with a relatively vague concept of "element", so it doesn't explicitly
reference triangles/etc, and the selectable-elements and how-elements-are-selected
concepts are provided by abstract-interfaces that allow various implememtations.

The "Geometry Objects", eg like a DynamicMeshComponent, Gameplay Volume, etc, are
referred to as "Active Targets" in the Manager. External code provides and updates
the set of Active Targets, eg for example tracking the active Actor Selection in the Editor.

For a given Target, a tuple (Selector, Selection, SelectionEditor) is created and maintained.
The FGeometrySelection is ultimately a basic list of integers and does not have any knowledge
of what it is a selection *of*, and is not intended to be directly edited. Instead the
SelectionEditor provides that functionality. This separation allows "selection editing" to
be customized, eg to enforce invariants or constraints that might apply to certain kinds of selections.

The IGeometrySelector provides the core implementation of what "selection" means for a given
Target, eg like a mesh Component, or mesh object like a UDynamicMesh. The Selector is
created by a registered Factory, allowing client code to provide custom implementations for
different Target Types. Updates to the Selection are done via the Selector, as well as queries
about (eg) renderable selection geometry. 3D Transforms are also applied via the Selector,
as only it has the knowledge about what can be transformed and how it can be applied.

The GeometrySelectionManager provides high-level interfaces for this system, for example
external code (eg such as something that creates a Gizmo for the active selection) only
needs to interact with SelectionManager, calling functions like
::BeginTransformation() / ::UpdateTransformation() / ::EndTransformation().
The SelectionManager also handles Transactions/FChanges for the active Targets and Selections.
