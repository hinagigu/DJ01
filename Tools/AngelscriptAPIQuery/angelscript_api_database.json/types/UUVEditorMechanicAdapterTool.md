# UUVEditorMechanicAdapterTool

**继承自**: `UInteractiveTool`

This is a dummy tool that only exists to make it possible for mechanics to be used in
outside of an actual tool. The tool can be passed in to the mechanics' Setup() calls.
If necessary, the behaviors can be extracted via GetInputBehaviors() to be placed into
an input router.
