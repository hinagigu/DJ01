This is generally a subset of an InteractiveTool,\nfor example an interaction to draw a polygon could be used in many tools, but requires handling input events\nand converting them to click points on a plane, handling various cases like closing a loop, undo/redo of points, etc.\nIdeally all these aspects should be able to be wrapped up in an UInteractionMechanic that multiple Tools can use.\n\n(This class is still a work in progress)",
