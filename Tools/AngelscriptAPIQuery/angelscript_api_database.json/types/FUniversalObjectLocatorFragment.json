  "doc": "Universal Object Locator (UOL) Fragments provide an extensible mechanism for referencing permanent, transient\n  or dynamically created objects relative to an external context. UOLs comprise zero or more nested fragments.\n\nCreation and resolution of a fragment requires a context to be provided;\n  normally this will be the object on which the UOL exists as a property.\n\nThe way in which the object is referenced is defined by globally registered 'FragmentTypes'\n  (See IUniversalObjectLocatorModule::RegisterFragmentType). Each FragmentType can be thought of as somewhat\n  equivalent to a www URI fragment type, though the 'path' is not necessarily just a string, but includes\n  support for the full set of Engine Property types.\n\nThe type is implemented as a type-erased payload block, a fragment type handle and some internal flags.\nPayloads will be allocated using the inline memory if alignment and size constraints allow, but\n  will fall back to a heap allocation if necessary. Allocation should be avoided by keeping payload\n  types small.\n\nAligned to 8 bytes, 32 (runtime) or 64 (editor) bytes big.",
