# UToolTarget

**继承自**: `UObject`

A tool target is a stand-in object that a tool can operate on. It exposes the necessary
interfaces to the tool.

There are two intended purposes of the tool target system:
1. Allow tools to operate on arbitrary objects as long as they can be made to provide the
  tool with the necessary inputs. For instance, a mesh editing tool should be able to operate
  on skeletal, static, volume, and other mesh as long as the target manager has a registered
  factory that can use that type of mesh to create a suitable target.
2. (not yet used) Help cache tool inputs. I.e., if a tool requires an expensive
  conversion before it can work on an item, the converted result can be stored in the
  tool target which can be cached by the target manager and provided the next time the
  same type of target is requested for that item.

Given an object, tool builders usually ask the target manager to turn it into a target that
has the interfaces the tools needs. The tools cast the target to those interfaces to use
them.
