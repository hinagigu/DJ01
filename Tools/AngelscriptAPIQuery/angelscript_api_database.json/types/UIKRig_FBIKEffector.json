If Chain Depth is 0, the chain root is set to the nearest fork in the skeleton.\nThese chains are pre-rotated and translated, as a whole, towards the effector targets.\nThis can improve the results for sparse bone chains, and significantly improve convergence on dense bone chains.\nBut it may cause undesirable results in highly constrained bone chains (like robot arms)."
