      "This threshold is used to detect occlusion artefacts (e.g., silhouettes/blotches in the base color) so that texels\nexhibiting them can be cleaned up i.e., rejected and filled in using the values of nearby valid texels instead.\n\nIf the threshold is zero, the cleanup step is skipped.\nIf the threshold is too large, texels with artefacts won't be detected and the cleanup step is effectively skipped.\nIf the threshold is too small, texels without artefacts get detected and results will be bad because there won't\nbe enough nearby valid texels from which to infill values.\n\nA good starting point is to choose a threshold around the size of the distance (in world space) between the\ntarget and source meshes; if the target was generated by VoxWrap then the voxel size estimates this distance."
