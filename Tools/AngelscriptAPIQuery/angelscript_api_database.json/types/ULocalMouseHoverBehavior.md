# ULocalMouseHoverBehavior

**继承自**: `UMouseHoverBehavior`

An implementation of UMouseHoverBehavior that also implements IHoverBehaviorTarget directly, via a set
of local lambda functions. To use/customize this class, the client replaces the lambda functions with their own.
This avoids having to create a separate IHoverBehaviorTarget implementation for trivial use-cases.
