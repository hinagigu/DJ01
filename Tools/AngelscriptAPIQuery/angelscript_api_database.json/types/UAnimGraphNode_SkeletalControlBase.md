# UAnimGraphNode_SkeletalControlBase

**继承自**: `UAnimGraphNode_Base`

This is the base class for the 'source version' of all skeletal control animation graph nodes
(nodes that manipulate the pose rather than playing animations to create a pose or blending between poses)

Concrete subclasses should contain a member struct derived from FAnimNode_SkeletalControlBase
