# UGameFeatureOptionalContentInstaller

**继承自**: `UObject`

Utilty class to install GFP optional paks (usually containing optional mips) in sync with GFP content installs.
NOTE: This only currently supports LRU cached install bundles. It would need UI callbacks and additional support
for free space checks and progress tracking to fully support non-LRU GFPs.
