# UEditorInteractiveGizmoSubsystem

**继承自**: `UEditorSubsystem`

The InteractiveGizmoSubsystem provides methods for registering and unregistering
selection-based gizmo builders. This subsystem will be queried for qualified
builders based on the current selection.

This subsystem should be used to register gizmo selection-based builders which are not specific
to an ed mode or asset editor.
For gizmo selection-based builders which are specific to an ed mode or asset editor,
register with the UEditorinteractiveGizmoManager instead, when the ed mode or asset editor
starts up (and deregister when the mode or asset editor shuts down).

Plugins registering gizmo types should bind to the delegates returned by:
- OnEditorGizmoSubsystemRegisterEditorGizmoTypes()
- OnEditorGizmoSubsystemDeregisterEditorGizmoTypes()
to register and dergister their gizmo builders.
