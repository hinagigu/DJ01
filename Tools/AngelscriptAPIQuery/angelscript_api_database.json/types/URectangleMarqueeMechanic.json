It creates and maintains the 2D rectangle associated with a mouse drag.\n* It does not test against any scene geometry, nor does it maintain any sort of list of selected objects.\n*\n* When using this mechanic, you should call Render() on it in the tool's Render() call so that it can cache\n* necessary camera state, and DrawHUD() in the tool's DrawHUD() call so that it can draw the box.\n*\n* Attach to the mechanic's delegates and use the passed rectangle to test against your geometry.",
