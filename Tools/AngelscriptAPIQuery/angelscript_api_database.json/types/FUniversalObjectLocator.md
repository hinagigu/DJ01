# FUniversalObjectLocator

Universal Object Locators (UOLs) define an address to an object.

The address is implemented as a chain of FUniversalObjectLocatorFragments, allowing addressing of objects
  that may be nested deeply within levels of externally defined spawn or ownership logic.

For example, a Universal Object Locator may reference an Anim Instance within a Skeletal Mesh Actor
  is spawned by a Child Actor Component that is spawned by Sequencer. This is impossible with a
  regular soft object path, but is perfectly feasible for a UOL.

This type is 16 bytes.
