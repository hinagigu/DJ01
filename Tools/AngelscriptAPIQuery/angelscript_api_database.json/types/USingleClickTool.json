  "doc": "USingleClickTool is perhaps the simplest possible interactive tool. It simply\nreacts to default primary button clicks for the active device (eg left-mouse clicks).\n\nThe function ::IsHitByClick() determines what is clickable by this Tool. The default is\nto return true, which means the click will activate anywhere (the Tool itself has no\nnotion of Actors, Components, etc). You can override this function to, for example,\nfilter out clicks that don't hit a target object, etc.\n\nThe function ::OnClicked() implements the action that will occur when a click happens.\nYou must override this to implement any kind of useful behavior.",
