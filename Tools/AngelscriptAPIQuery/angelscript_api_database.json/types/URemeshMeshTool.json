The\nfunction URemeshMeshToolBuilder::CanBuildTool will return true only when a single mesh is selected, and the tool will\nonly be applied to the first mesh in the selection list. The reason we inherit from UMultiSelectionTool is so\nthat subclasses of this class can work with multiple meshes (see, for example, UProjectToTargetTool.)",
