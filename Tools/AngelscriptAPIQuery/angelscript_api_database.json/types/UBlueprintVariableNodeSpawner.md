# UBlueprintVariableNodeSpawner

**继承自**: `UBlueprintFieldNodeSpawner`

Takes care of spawning variable getter/setter nodes. Serves as the "action"
portion for certain FBlueprintActionMenuItems. Evolved from
FEdGraphSchemaAction_K2Var, and can spawn nodes for both member-variables and
local function variables.
