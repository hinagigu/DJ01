# USequencerToolsFunctionLibrary

**继承自**: `UBlueprintFunctionLibrary`

This is a set of helper functions to access various parts of the Sequencer API via Python. Because Sequencer itself is not suitable for exposing, most functionality
gets wrapped by UObjects that have an easier API to work with. This UObject provides access to these wrapper UObjects where needed.
