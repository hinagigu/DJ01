One should\nthink of a SoundNodeDistanceCrossFade as Mixer node which determines the set of nodes to\n\"mix in\" based on their distance to the sound.\n\nExample:\nYou have a gun that plays a fire sound.  At long distances you want a different sound than\nif you were up close.   So you use a SoundNodeDistanceCrossFade which will calculate the distance\na listener is from the sound and play either:  short distance, long distance, mix of short and long sounds.\n\nA SoundNodeDistanceCrossFade differs from an SoundNodeAttenuation in that any sound is only going\nbe played if it is within the MinRadius and MaxRadius.  So if you want the short distance sound to be\nheard by people close to it, the MinRadius should probably be 0\n\nThe volume curve for a SoundNodeDistanceCrossFade will look like this:\n\n                         Volume (of the input)\n   FadeInDistance.Max --> _________________ <-- FadeOutDistance.Min\n                         /                 \\\n                        /                   \\\n                       /                     \\\nFadeInDistance.Min -->/                       \\ <-- FadeOutDistance.Max",
