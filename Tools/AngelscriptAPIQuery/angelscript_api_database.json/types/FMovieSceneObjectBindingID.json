  "doc": "Persistent identifier to a specific object binding within a sequence hierarchy.\n\nBinding IDs come in 3 flavors with Local and External being preferred as they are reslilient towards sequences being authored in isolation or included in other root sequences:\n    Local: (ResolveParentIndex == 0) SequenceID relates to _this sequence's_ local hierarchy; represents an object binding within the same sequence as the ID is resolved, or inside one of its sub-sequences. Sequence ID must be remapped at runtime.\n    External: (ResolveParentIndex > 0) SequenceID is local to the parent sequence of this one denoted by the parent index (ie, 1 = parent, 2 = grandparent etc). Sequence ID must be remapped at runtime.\n    Fixed: Represents a binding anywhere in the sequence; always resolved from the root sequence.\n\nFixed bindings will break if the sequence is evaluated inside a different root sequence.",
