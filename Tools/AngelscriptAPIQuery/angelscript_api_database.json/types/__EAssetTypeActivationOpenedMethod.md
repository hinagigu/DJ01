# __EAssetTypeActivationOpenedMethod

(jcotton) This enum has been extracted into a separate header as it would ideally live in IAssetTypeActions.h or AssetTypeActions_Base.h,
however these files are included without module linking (IncludePathModuleNames) in several other modules which makes adding a UENUM() not
possible without refactoring.
