# UPreviewMesh

**继承自**: `UObject`

UPreviewMesh is a utility object that spawns and owns a transient mesh object in the World.
This can be used to show live preview geometry during modeling operations.
Call CreateInWorld() to set it up, and Disconnect() to shut it down.

Currently implemented via an internal Actor that has a UDynamicMeshComponent root component,
with an AABBTree created/updated if FProperty bBuildSpatialDataStructure=true.
The Actor is destroyed on Disconnect().

The intention with UPreviewMesh is to provide a higher-level interface than the Component.
In future the internal Component may be replaced with another class (eg OctreeDynamicMeshComponent),
or automatically swap between the two, etc.

As a result direct access to the Actor/Component, or a non-const FDynamicMesh3, is intentionally not provided.
Wrapper functions are provided (or should be added) for necessary Actor/Component parameters.
To edit the mesh either a copy is done, or EditMesh()/ApplyChange() must be used.
These functions automatically update necessary internal data structures.
