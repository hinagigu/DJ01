# UPatternTool

**继承自**: `UMultiSelectionMeshEditingTool`

UPatternTool takes input meshes and generates 3D Patterns of those meshes, by
placing repeated copies along geometric paths like lines, grids, circles, etc.
The output can be a single Actor per pattern Element, or combined into single
Actors in various ways depending on the input mesh type.
