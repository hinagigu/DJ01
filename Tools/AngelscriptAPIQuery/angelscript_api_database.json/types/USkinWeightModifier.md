# USkinWeightModifier

**继承自**: `UObject`

API used to modify skin weights on a Skeletal Mesh asset.

To use:
1. Instantiate an instance of USkinWeightModifier
2. Call "SetSkeletalMesh(MyMeshAsset)", passing in the skeletal mesh you want to edit weights on
3. Use Get/Set weights functions, and Normalize/Prune to edit the weights as desired
4. When ready to commit to the asset, call CommitWeightsToSkeletalMesh() and save the asset if desired

This API can be used from C++, Blueprint or Python. Here is a sample usage of the API in Python:

import unreal

# create a weight modifier for a given skeletal mesh
skel_mesh = unreal.EditorAssetLibrary().load_asset("/Game/Characters/Wolf/Meshes/SK_Wolf")
weight_modifier = unreal.SkinWeightModifier()
weight_modifier.set_skeletal_mesh(skel_mesh)

# get weight of vertex 1234
vertex_weights = weight_modifier.get_vertex_weights(1234)
print(vertex_weights)

# remove neck2 as an influence on this vertex
vertex_weights.pop("neck2")
weight_modifier.set_vertex_weights(vertex_weights, True)
print(vertex_weights)

# commit change to the skeletal mesh
weight_modifier.commit_weights_to_skeletal_mesh()

OUTPUT:
{"head": 0.6, "neck1": 0.3, "neck2": 0.1}
{"head": 0.6, "neck1": 0.3}

In Python, the per-vertex weights are stored as a dictionary mapping Bone Names to float weight values.

The "SetVertexWeights()" function expects the same data structure. You can add/remove/edit influences as needed.
The SetVertexWeights() function does not normalize the weights. So you can make multiple modifications
and call NormalizeVertexWeights() or NormalizeAllWeights() as desired.

The PruneVertexWeights() and EnforceMaxInfluences() functions can be used to trim small influences
and clamp the total number of influences per vertex as needed.

Note that it is not required to normalize the weights by calling any of the normalize functions. Or manually before
calling SetVertexWeights(). Committing the weights to the skeletal mesh will always enforce normalization.

Though it may be useful to normalize while editing.

## 方法

### CommitWeightsToSkeletalMesh
```angelscript
bool CommitWeightsToSkeletalMesh()
```
Actually applies the weight modifications to the skeletal mesh. This action creates an undo transaction.
The skeletal mesh asset will be dirtied, but it is up to the user to save the asset if required.
@return true if weights were applied to a skeletal mesh, false otherwise

### EnforceMaxInfluences
```angelscript
bool EnforceMaxInfluences(int MaxInfluences)
```
Strips out smallest influences to ensure each vertex does not have weight on more influences than MaxInfluences.
Influences with the smallest weight are culled first.
@param MaxInfluences The maximum number of influences to allow for each vertex in the mesh. If -1 is passed, will use the project-wide MaxInfluences amount.
@return true if influences were removed, false otherwise

### GetAllBoneNames
```angelscript
TArray<FName> GetAllBoneNames()
```
Get an array of all bone names in the skeletal mesh.
@return array of bone names

### GetNumVertices
```angelscript
int GetNumVertices()
```
Get the total number of vertices in the skeletal mesh.
@return int, number of vertices

### GetSkeletalMesh
```angelscript
USkeletalMesh GetSkeletalMesh()
```
Get a reference to the skeletal mesh that was loaded
@return USkeletalMesh* - the mesh that was loaded, or null

### GetVertexWeights
```angelscript
TMap<FName,float32> GetVertexWeights(int VertexID)
```
Get all bone weights for a single vertex.
@param VertexID the index of the vertex
@return a map of Bone Name to weight values for all bones that influence the specified vertex.

### NormalizeAllWeights
```angelscript
bool NormalizeAllWeights()
```
Normalize weights on all vertices in the mesh.
@return true if normalization was performed, false otherwise

### NormalizeVertexWeights
```angelscript
bool NormalizeVertexWeights(int VertexID)
```
Normalize weights on the specified vertex.
@param VertexID the index of the vertex to normalize weights on
@return true if normalization was performed, false otherwise

### PruneAllWeights
```angelscript
bool PruneAllWeights(float32 WeightThreshold)
```
Remove all weights below the given threshold value, on all vertices.
@param WeightThreshold vertex weights below this value will be removed.
@return true if influences were removed, false otherwise

### PruneVertexWeights
```angelscript
bool PruneVertexWeights(int VertexID, float32 WeightThreshold)
```
Remove all weights below the given threshold value, on the given vertex.
Influences that are pruned will no longer receive weight from normalization.
@param VertexID the index of the vertex to prune weights on
@param WeightThreshold vertex weights below this value will be removed.
@return true if influences were removed, false otherwise

### SetSkeletalMesh
```angelscript
bool SetSkeletalMesh(USkeletalMesh InMesh)
```
Call this first to load the weights for a skeletal mesh for fast editing.
@param InMesh - The skeletal mesh asset to load for weight editing
@return bool - true if the mesh weights were successfully loaded.

### SetVertexWeights
```angelscript
bool SetVertexWeights(int VertexID, TMap<FName,float32> InWeights, bool bReplaceAll)
```
Set bone weights for a single vertex. The weights are stored as supplied and not normalized until
either "CommitWeightsToSkeletalMesh()" or "NormalizeVertexWeights()" is called.
@param VertexID the index of the vertex
@param InWeights a map of Bone-Name to Weight for all bones that influence the specified vertex, ie {"Head": 0.6, "Neck": 0.4}
@param bReplaceAll if true, all weights on this vertex will be replaced with the input weights. Default is false.
