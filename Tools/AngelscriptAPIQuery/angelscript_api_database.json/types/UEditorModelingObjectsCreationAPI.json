This can be used to do\n   things like pop up an interactive path-selection dialog, use project-defined paths, etc\n - OnModelingMeshCreated is broadcast for each new created mesh object\n - OnModelingTextureCreated is broadcast for each new created texture object\n - OnModelingMaterialCreated is broadcast for each new created material object",
