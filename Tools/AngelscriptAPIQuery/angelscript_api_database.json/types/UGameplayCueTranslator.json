  "doc": "This is the base class for GameplayCue Translators. This is what games must extend from in order to add their own rules.\nThese are not instantiated, and are basically just a holder for virtual functions that are called on the CDO.\n\nThere are two main things this class provides:\n        1. A set of translation rules. E.g., \"I translate GameplayCue.A.B.C into GameplayCue.X.B.C\", or rather \"I translate A into X\". (GetTranslationNameSpawns)\n        2. A runtime function to actually do the translation, based on the actors and parameters involved in the gameplay cue event. (GameplayCueToTranslationIndex)",
