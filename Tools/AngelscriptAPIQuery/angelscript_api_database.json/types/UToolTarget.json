  "doc": "A tool target is a stand-in object that a tool can operate on. It exposes the necessary\ninterfaces to the tool.\n\nThere are two intended purposes of the tool target system:\n1. Allow tools to operate on arbitrary objects as long as they can be made to provide the\n  tool with the necessary inputs. For instance, a mesh editing tool should be able to operate\n  on skeletal, static, volume, and other mesh as long as the target manager has a registered\n  factory that can use that type of mesh to create a suitable target.\n2. (not yet used) Help cache tool inputs. I.e., if a tool requires an expensive\n  conversion before it can work on an item, the converted result can be stored in the\n  tool target which can be cached by the target manager and provided the next time the\n  same type of target is requested for that item.\n\nGiven an object, tool builders usually ask the target manager to turn it into a target that\nhas the interfaces the tools needs. The tools cast the target to those interfaces to use\nthem.",
