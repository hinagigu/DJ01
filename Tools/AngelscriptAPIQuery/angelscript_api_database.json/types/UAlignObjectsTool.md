# UAlignObjectsTool

**继承自**: `UMultiSelectionMeshEditingTool`

UAlignObjectsTool transforms the input Components so that they are aligned in various ways, depending on the current settings.
The object positions move after every change in the parameters. Currently those changes are not transacted.
On cancel the original positions are restored, and on accept the positions are updated with a transaction.
