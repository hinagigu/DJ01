If WorldAlpha = 0.0, the system is disabled and the simulation will\nbe fully local (i.e., world-space actor movement and rotation does not affect the simulation). When WorldAlpha = 1.0 the simulation effectively acts as a\nworld-space sim, but with the ability to apply limits using the other parameters."

It is not usually required to\nchange this but you would reduce this to limit the effects of drag on the bodies in the simulation (if you have bodies that have LinearDrag set to non-zero in the physics asset).\nExpected values in this case would be somewhat less than the usual velocities of your object which is commonly a few hundred for a character."

Units are radian/s, so a value of about 6.0 is one rotation per second.\nThe default value effectively means \"unlimited\". You would reduce this (and MaxAngularAcceleration) to limit how much bodies \"fly out\" when the actor spins on the spot.\nThis is especially useful if you have characters than can rotate very quickly and you would probably want values around or less than 10 in this case."

It is useful when you have characters than can\nchanges from stationary to running very quickly such as in an FPS. A common value for a character might be in the few hundreds."
