# UEditorInteractiveToolsContext

**继承自**: `UInteractiveToolsContext`

UEditorInteractiveToolsContext is an extension/adapter of an InteractiveToolsContext designed
for use in the UE Editor. Currently this implementation assumes that it is created by a
Mode Manager (FEditorModeTools), and that the Mode Manager will call various API functions
like Render() and Tick() when necessary.


allows it to be easily embedded inside an FEdMode. A set of functions are provided which can be
called from the FEdMode functions of the same name. These will handle the data type
conversions and forwarding calls necessary to operate the ToolsContext
