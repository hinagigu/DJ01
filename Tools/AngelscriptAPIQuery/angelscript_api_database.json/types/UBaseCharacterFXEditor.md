# UBaseCharacterFXEditor

**继承自**: `UAssetEditor`

Base UAssetEditor class for character simulation asset editors (e.g. cloth, hair, flesh).

Our current asset editor guidelines ask us to place as little business logic as possible
into the class, instead putting as much of the non-UI code into the subsystem as possible,
and the UI code into the toolkit (which this class owns).

However, since we're using a mode and the Interactive Tools Framework, a lot of our business logic
ends up inside the mode and the tools, not the subsystem. The front-facing code is mostly in
the asset editor toolkit, though the mode toolkit has most of the things that deal with the toolbar
on the left.
