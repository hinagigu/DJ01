      "ETranslucencyLightingMode",
      "Same as Volumetric Non Directional, but lighting is only evaluated at vertices so the pixel shader cost is significantly less.\nNote that lighting still comes from a volume texture, so it is limited in range.  Directional lights become unshadowed in the distance."

Use this on translucent surfaces like glass and water.\nThis is implemented with forward shading so specular highlights from local lights are supported, however many deferred-only features are not.\nThis is the most expensive translucency lighting method as each light's contribution is computed per-pixel."
