Second, if the constraint limits are exceeded\nby less than the tolerance, a semi-physical correction is applied,  with the parent body in the constraint is treated as having infinite mass.\nThe teleport tolerance are controlled by ProjectionLinearTolerance and ProjectionAngularTolerance. The semi-physical correction is controlled\nby ProjectionLinearAlpha and ProjectionAnguilarAlpha. You may have one, none, or both systems enabled at the same time.\n\nProjection only works well if the chain is not interacting with other objects (e.g., through collisions) because the projection of the bodies in\nthe chain will cause other constraints to be violated. Likewise, if a body is influenced by multiple constraints, then enabling projection on more\nthan one constraint may lead to unexpected results - the  \"last\" constraint would win but the order in which constraints are solved cannot be directly controlled.\n\nNote that the semi-physical projection (ProjectionLinearAlpha and ProjectionAngularAlpha) is only applied to hard-limit constraints and not those with\nsoft limits because the soft limit is the point at which the soft-constraint (spring) kicks in, and not really a limit on how far the joint can be separated."
