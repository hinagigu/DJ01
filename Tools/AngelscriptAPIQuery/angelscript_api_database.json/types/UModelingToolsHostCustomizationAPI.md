# UModelingToolsHostCustomizationAPI

**继承自**: `UObject`

An implementation of IToolHostCustomizationAPI meant to be used with modeling tools editor mode.
Mostly it just forwards the relevant requests to the mode toolkit, which changes its accept/cancel/complete
overlay buttons temporarily (until the next click of those buttons).
