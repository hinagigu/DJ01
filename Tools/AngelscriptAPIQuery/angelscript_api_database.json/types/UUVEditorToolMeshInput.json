It includes a UV unwrap mesh, a mesh with the UV layer applied,\nand background-op-compatible previews for each. It also has convenience methods\nfor updating all of the represenations from just one of them, using a \"fast update\"\ncode path when possible.\n\nThis tool target is a bit different from usual in that it is not created\nby a tool target manager, and therefore doesn't have an accompanying factory.\nInstead, it is created by the mode, because the mode has access to the worlds\nin which the previews need to be created.\n\nIt's arguable whether this should even inherit from UToolTarget.",
