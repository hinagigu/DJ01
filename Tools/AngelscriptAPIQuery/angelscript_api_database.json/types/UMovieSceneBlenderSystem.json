Blend 'channels' are allocated in this\nsystem which define a many to one relationship by corresponding blend input(many)/output(one) components\nadded to the relevant entities. Blend input and output channel components are uint16.\n\nThe class supports a maximum of 65535 blend channels.\n\nAdditionally, blender systems tag their inputs using the built in Absolute, Relative and Additive tags\nfor efficient computation of each type of blending (this allows each blend type to be computed without branching).\n\nA simple example of 3 blended floats is as follows:\n  Entity Data:\n      Inputs:\n        float [float component], uint16 [blend channel input], [Absolute Tag] => [ { 100.f, 0 }, { 200.f, 1 } ]\n        float [float component], uint16 [blend channel input], [Additive Tag] => [ { 50.f, 1} ]\n      Outputs:\n        float [float component], uint16 [blend channel output]                => [ { 0.f, 0}, { 0.f, 1} ]\nTo perform blending for this data, accumulation buffers are allocated per-blend-type, and each blend accumulates\ninto the index of its blend channel input component. A final combination pass walks over blend channel outputs\na writes the results into the result component from the accumulation buffer.",
