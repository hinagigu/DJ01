# UGameUIManagerSubsystem

**继承自**: `UGameInstanceSubsystem`

This manager is intended to be replaced by whatever your game needs to
actually create, so this class is abstract to prevent it from being created.

If you just need the basic functionality you will start by sublcassing this
subsystem in your own game.
