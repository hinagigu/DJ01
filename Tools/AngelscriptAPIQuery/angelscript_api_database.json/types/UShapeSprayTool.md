# UShapeSprayTool

**继承自**: `UDynamicMeshBrushTool`

UShapeSprayTool is a brush-based tool that generates random points on the
target surface within the brush radius, and then creates small meshes
at those points. The accumulated meshes are appended and can
be emitted as a new StaticMeshComponent on Accept.
