# UNetworkMetricsStats

**继承自**: `UNetworkMetricsBaseListener`

A metrics listener that reports a metric to a single Stat.

The function SetStatName() is expected to be called before the listener is registered with
FNetworkMetricsDatabase::Register(). This function will associate the instance of UNetworkMetricStats
with a specific Stat.

Since each instance of this class is associated with a single Stat it can only be registered
as a listener to a single metric in FNetworkMetricsDatabase.

UNetworkMetricsStats is not intended to be used from configuration files!
