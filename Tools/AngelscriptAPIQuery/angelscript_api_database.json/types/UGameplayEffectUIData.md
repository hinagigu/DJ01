# UGameplayEffectUIData

**继承自**: `UGameplayEffectComponent`

UGameplayEffectUIData
Base class to provide game-specific data about how to describe a Gameplay Effect in the UI. Subclass with data to use in your game.
In Unreal Engine 5.3, this now derives from UGameplayEffectComponent so you can use it directly as a GameplayEffectComponent.
