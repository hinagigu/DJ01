# UCommonUserBasicPresence

**继承自**: `UGameInstanceSubsystem`

This subsystem plugs into the session subsystem and pushes its information to the presence interface.
It is not intended to be a full featured rich presence implementation, but can be used as a proof-of-concept
for pushing information from the session subsystem to the presence system
