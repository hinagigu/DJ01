So for mouse input a single\nTool is available and effectively a lightweight mode. The mouse uses the \"Left\" tool slot.\n\nFor VR controllers and touch input, a \"Left\" and \"Right\" tool can be active at the same time.\n@todo this is not fully supported yet\n\nTools are not directly created. Use SelectActiveToolType(side,string) to set the active ToolBuilder\non a given side, and then use ActivateTool() to create the new Tool instance.",
