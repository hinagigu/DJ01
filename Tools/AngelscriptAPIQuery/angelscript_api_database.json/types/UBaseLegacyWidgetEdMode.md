# UBaseLegacyWidgetEdMode

**继承自**: `UEdMode`

This class is to aid transitioning from native FEdModes to UEdModes, in the case that the FEdMode used property widgets and/or transform widgets
To use this class:
  1. Subclass FLegacyEdModeWidgetHelper, and override the methods needed for your native FEdMode implementation
  2. Transition your native FEdMode to a UObject, by inheriting from this class
  3. Override CreateWidgetHelper function to return a SharedRef to the class you created in step 1.
