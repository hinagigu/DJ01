# AOnlineBeaconHostObject

**继承自**: `AActor`

Base class for any unique beacon connectivity, paired with an AOnlineBeaconClient implementation

By defining a beacon type and implementing the ability to spawn unique AOnlineBeaconClients, any two instances of the engine
can communicate with each other without officially connecting through normal Unreal networking
