The main use of this class is to support scaling\nin a 3D gizmo without actually scaling the Gizmo itself. Generally our pattern is to apply\nthe gizmo's position/rotation transform to the target object via a TransformProxy, but\nthat does not work with Scaling. So this class stores the scaling vector separately, provided by\nan external source via FSeparateScaleProvider, and in GetTransform/SetTransform rewrites the\nTransform from the child IGizmoTransformSource with the new scale.",
