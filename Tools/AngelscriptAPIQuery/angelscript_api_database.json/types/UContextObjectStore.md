# UContextObjectStore

**继承自**: `UObject`

A context object store allows tools to get access to arbitrary objects which expose data or APIs to enable additional functionality.
Some example use cases of context objects:
  - A tool builder may disallow a particular tool if a needed API object is not present in the context store.
  - A tool may allow extra actions if it has access to a particular API object in the context store.
  - A tool may choose to initialize itself differently based on the presence of a selection-holding data object in the context store.
