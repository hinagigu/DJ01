For example, imagine we have\na blend space for locomotion, moving left, forward and right. Now if you interpolate the inputs of\nthe blend space itself, from one extreme to the other, you will go from left, to forward, to right.\nAs an alternative, by setting this Sample Weight Speed to a value higher than zero, it will go\ndirectly from left to right, without going through moving forward first.\n\nSmaller values mean slower adjustments of the sample weights, and thus more smoothing. However, a\nvalue of zero disables this smoothing entirely."
