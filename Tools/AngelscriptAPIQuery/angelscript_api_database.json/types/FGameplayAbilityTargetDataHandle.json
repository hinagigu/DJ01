This servers two main purposes:\n        -Avoid us having to copy around the full targeting data structure in Blueprints\n        -Allows us to leverage polymorphism in the target data structure\n        -Allows us to implement NetSerialize and replicate by value between clients/server\n\n        -Avoid using UObjects could be used to give us polymorphism and by reference passing in blueprints.\n        -However we would still be screwed when it came to replication\n\n        -Replication by value\n        -Pass by reference in blueprints\n        -Polymophism in TargetData structure",
