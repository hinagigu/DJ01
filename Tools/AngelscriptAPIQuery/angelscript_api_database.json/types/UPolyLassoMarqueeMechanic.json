  "doc": "* Mechanic for a PolyLasso \"marquee\" selection. It creates and maintains the 2D PolyLasso associated with a mouse drag.\n* It does not test against any scene geometry, nor does it maintain any sort of list of selected objects.\n*\n* The PolyLasso has two potential modes, a freehand polyline and a multi-click polygon. By default both are enabled\n* but this can be selectively controlled with flags below. If a click-and-release is within a small distance tolerance,\n* then a multi-click polygon is entered, and must be exited by clicking again at the start point. The freehand polyline\n* is drawn by click-dragging, and exited by releasing the mouse.\n*\n* When using this mechanic, you should call DrawHUD() in the tool's DrawHUD() call so that it can draw the box.\n*\n* Attach to the mechanic's delegates and use the passed PolyLasso to test against your geometry.",
