# USingleClickOrDragInputBehavior

**继承自**: `UAnyButtonInputBehavior`

USingleClickOrDragInputBehavior is a combination of a USingleClickBehavior and UClickDragBehavior,
and allows for the common UI interaction where a click-and-release does one action, but if the mouse
is moved, then a drag interaction is started. For example click-to-select is often combined with
a drag-marquee-rectangle in this way. This can be directly implemented with a UClickDragBehavior but
requires the client to (eg) detect movement thresholds, etc. This class encapsulates all that state/logic.

The .ClickDistanceThreshold parameter determines how far the mouse must move (in whatever device units are in use)
to switch from a click to drag interaction

The .bBeginDragIfClickTargetNotHit parameter determines if the drag interaction will be immediately initiated
if the initial 'click' mouse-down does not hit a valid clickable target. Defaults to true.

The hit-test and on-clicked functions are provided by a IClickBehaviorTarget instance, while an
IClickDragBehaviorTarget provides the can-click-drag/begin-drag/update-drag/end-drag functionality.
