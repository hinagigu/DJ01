(Cross level attachment and undo/redo pain)\n\nThe LevelInstance Level Actors are attached to this ALevelInstanceEditorInstanceActor keeping the attachment local to the Instance Level and shielded from the transaction buffer.\n\nAvoiding those Level Actors from being part of the Transaction system allows us to unload that level without clearing the transaction buffer. It also allows BP Reinstancing without having to update attachements.",
