# UCachedAnalysisProperties

**继承自**: `UObject`

This will be used to preserve values as far as possible when switching between analysis functions, so it contains all
the parameters used by the engine functions. User defined can inherit from this and add their own - then the
user-defined MakeCache function should replace any base class cache that is passed in with their own.
