# UConstraintsManager

**继承自**: `UObject`

UConstraintsManager
This object gathers the different static/nonanimated constraints of the level and is held by the ConstraintsActor (unique in the level)
Note in 5.4 all of the constraints are owned by the subsystem, so need to get that to get at animated constraints
