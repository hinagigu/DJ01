For instance, a single disconnected quad-like group\nwould normally have a single group edge with no corners, since it has no neighboring groups, but this\nsetting will allow for the generation of corners at the quad corners, which is very useful for editing.\nNote that the setting takes effect only after clicking Regenerate Extra Corners or performing some\noperation that changes the group topology."

For instance, 180 will place corners at every vertex along a group\nedge even if the edge is perfectly straight, and 135 will place a vertex only once the edge bends 45 degrees off the straight path\n(i.e. 135 degrees to the previous edge).\nThe setting is applied either when Regenerate Extra Corners is clicked, or after any operation that modifies topology."
