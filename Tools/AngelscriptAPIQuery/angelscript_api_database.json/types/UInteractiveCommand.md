# UInteractiveCommand

**继承自**: `UObject`

A UInteractiveCommand is an atomic action that can be executed via some user interaction.
For example clicking a button that deletes an active selection can be considered an Interactive Command.
This differs from an Interactive Tool in that there is no ongoing user interaction once the
command has been initiated.
