# UWorldMetricsExtension

**继承自**: `UObject`

Base class for an extension for the World Metrics subsystem.

World Metrics subsystem extensions provide custom data/functionality to world metrics and other extensions (one to
many) and have the following characteristics:
1. Unique: there can only be a single instance of each extension class.
2. Exclusively managed and owned by the  World Metrics subsystem.. These should never be created directly.
3. Implement acquired/release semantics. The World Metrics subsystem automatically initializes extensions on
acquisition and deinitializes them on release. The subsystem may deallocate an extension that have no acquisitions.
