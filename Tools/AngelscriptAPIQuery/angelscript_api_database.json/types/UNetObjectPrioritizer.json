  "doc": "NetObjectPrioritizers are responsible for determining how important it is to replicate an object. Priorities should be at least 0.0f,\nmeaning no need to replicate. At 1.0f objects are being considered for replication. Priorities are acumulated per object and connection\nuntil it's replicated, at which point the priority is reset to zero. Bandwidth constraints and other factors may cause a highly prioritized\nobject to still not be replicated to a particular connection a certain frame. There is no mechanism to force an object to be replicated a\ncertain frame, but the priority is a major factor in the decision.",
