The user is responsible for removing them when no longer\n  needed so they can be garbage collected.\n- Metrics can have extensions to add shared functionality.\n- Extensions implement the UWorldMetricsExtension class and use Acquire/Release semantics. They can be acquired by\n  either metrics or extensions. Initialization and deinitialization are the ideal phases to do so.\n- The subsystem solely owns extensions and can automatically remove them for garbage collection whenever they are no\n  longer acquired by any metric or extension.",
