Your project may want to create its own.\nThe MetaData default bind keys (LMB, RMB, Q, E, etc) are a convenience for designers setting up abilities sets\nor whatever other data you have that gives an ability with a default key binding. Actual key binding is up to DefaultInput.ini\n\nE.g., \"Ability1\" is the command string that is bound to AbilitySystemComponent::ActivateAbility(1). The Meta data only *suggests*\nthat you are binding \"Ability1\" to LMB by default in your projects DefaultInput.ini.",
