# URigVMMemoryStorageGeneratorClass

**继承自**: `UClass`

The URigVMMemoryStorageGeneratorClass is used to create / represent heterogeneous
memory storages. The generator can produce a UClass which contains a series of
properties. This UClass is then used to instantiate URigVMMemoryStorage objects
to be consumed by the RigVM. The memory storage objects can contain the literals
/ constant values used by the virtual machine or work state.
