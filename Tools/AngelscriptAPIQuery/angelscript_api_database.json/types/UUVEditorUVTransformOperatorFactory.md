# UUVEditorUVTransformOperatorFactory

**继承自**: `UObject`

Can be hooked up to a UMeshOpPreviewWithBackgroundCompute to perform UV Transform operations.

Inherits from UObject so that it can hold a strong pointer to the settings UObject, which
needs to be a UObject to be displayed in the details panel.
