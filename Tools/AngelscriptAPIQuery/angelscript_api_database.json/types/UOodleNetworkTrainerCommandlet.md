# UOodleNetworkTrainerCommandlet

**继承自**: `UCommandlet`

Commandlet for processing UE packet captures, through Oodle's training API, for generating compressed state dictionaries.


Primary Commands:
    - "AutoGenerateDictionaries Changelist":
            - Iterates every directory recursively within "*Game*\Saved\Oodle\Server", and uses all capture files within each directory,
                    to generate a dictionary stored in "*Game*\Content\Oodle", named "*Game**DirectoryName*.udic".

            - For example, packet captures in "OrionGame\Saved\Oodle\Server\Input", will be generated into a dictionary stored in
                    "OrionGame\Content\Oodle\OrionGameInput.udic"

            - Each folder within "*Game*\Content\Oodle", should contain at least 100mb of packet captures.

            - Changelist is an optional parameter than will only use upac files that contain the changelist in their filenames. If
                    omitted, all files in the directory are used.


Secondary/Testing Commands:
    - "Enable":
            - Inserts the Oodle PacketHandler into the games packet handler component list, and initializes Oodle *Engine.ini settings


    - "MergePackets OutputFile PacketFile1,PacketFile2,PacketFileN":
            - Takes the specified packet capture files, and merges them into a single packet capture file

    - "MergePackets OutputFile All Directory":
            - As above, but merges all capture files in the specified directory.


    - "GenerateDictionary OutputFile FilenameFilter Changelist PacketFile1,PacketFile2,PacketFileN":
            - Takes the specified packet capture files, with an optional filter for a substring of a filename and changelist filter
                    (use "all" to ignore either of these filters), and uses them to generate a network compression dictionary

    - "GenerateDictionary OutputFile FilenameFilter Changelist All Directory":
            - As above, but uses all capture files in the specified directory, to generate a network compression dictionary


    - "DebugDump OutputDirectory CaptureDirectory Changelist"
            - Recursively iterates all .ucap files in CaptureDirectory, and converts them to Oodle-example-code compatible .bin files,
                    in OutputDirectory


@todo #JohnB: Unimplemented commands:
    - "PacketInfo PacketFile":
            - Outputs information about the packet file, such as the MB amount of data recorded, per net connection channel, and data types
            - @todo #JohnB: Only implement, if deciding to actually capture/track this kind of data
