# UDataStreamManager

**继承自**: `UDataStream`

The DataStreamManager contains all active DataStreams that may serialize data.
Calls to the DataStream interface functions will be forwarded to active streams.
Which streams will be automatically created or allowed to be manually created
need to be configured via UDataStreamDefinitions.
