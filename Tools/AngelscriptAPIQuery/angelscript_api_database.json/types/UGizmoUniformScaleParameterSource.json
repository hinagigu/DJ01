  "doc": "UGizmoUniformScaleParameterSource is an IGizmoVec2ParameterSource implementation that\ninterprets the Vec2 parameter as the position in a 2D plane, and maps this parameter to a\nchange in a uniform scale value. This scale is applied to an IGizmoTransformSource.\n\nThe X/Y plane parameter deltas are converted to a uniform scale delta simply by adding them.\nThis assumpes that the 3D plane is oriented such that \"positive\" along the X and Y\ntangent axes corresponds to something semantically meaningful. It's up to the client to do this.\n\nThis ParameterSource is intended to be used to create 3D Uniform Scale Gizmos.",
