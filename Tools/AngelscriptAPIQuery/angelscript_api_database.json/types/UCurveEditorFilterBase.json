This allows projects to easily create custom filters to edit curve\ndata as they only have to implement this class. Any UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) properties exposed on the class will\nshow up in the Curve Editor Filter panel which allows you to easily create customizable properties or advanced filters\nthat rely on user supplied settings.\n\nThe CDO is directly edited in the Curve Editor Filter panel so if you wish to save user settings between runs you can\nadd the \"config\" property to your UPROPERTY() and it will automatically get saved.",
