# UDataflowEditorMode

**继承自**: `UBaseCharacterFXEditorMode`

The dataflow editor mode is the mode used in the cloth asset editor. It holds most of the inter-tool state.
We put things in a mode instead of directly into the asset editor in case we want to someday use the mode
in multiple asset editors.
