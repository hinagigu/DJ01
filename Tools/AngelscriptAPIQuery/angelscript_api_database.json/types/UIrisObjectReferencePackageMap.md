# UIrisObjectReferencePackageMap

**继承自**: `UPackageMap`

Custom packagemap implementation used to be able to capture UObject* references from external serialization.
Any object references written when using this packagemap will be added to the References array and serialized as an index.
When reading using this packagemap references will be read as an index and resolved by picking the corresponding entry from the provided array containing the references.
