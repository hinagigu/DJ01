# FDataflowTerminalNode

FDataflowTerminalNode
             Base class for terminal nodes within the Dataflow graph.

             Terminal Nodes allow for non-const access to UObjects as
      edges in the graph. They are used to push data out to
      asset or the world from the calling client. Terminals
      may not have outputs, they are only leaf nodes in the
      evaluation graph.
