# UBlueprintExtension

**继承自**: `UObject`

Per-instance extension object that can be added to UBlueprint::Extensions in order to augment built-in blueprint functionality
Ideally this would be an editor-only class, but such classes are not permitted within Engine modules (even inside WITH_EDITORONLY_DATA blocks)
