      "float32",

      "(Default is PrePull) Set the behavior of the solver root.\nPre Pull: translates and rotates the root (and all children) by the average motion of the stretched effectors to help achieve faster convergence when reaching far.\nPin to Input: locks the translation and rotation of the root bone to the input pose. Overrides any bone settings applied to the root. Good for partial-body solves.\nFree: treats the root bone like any other and allows it to move freely or according to any bone settings applied to it."
