  "doc": "UGeometrySelectionManager provides the infrastructure for \"Element Selection\", ie\ngeometric sub-elements of some geometry object like a Triangle Mesh. The Manager is\ndesigned to work with a relatively vague concept of \"element\", so it doesn't explicitly\nreference triangles/etc, and the selectable-elements and how-elements-are-selected\nconcepts are provided by abstract-interfaces that allow various implememtations.\n\nThe \"Geometry Objects\", eg like a DynamicMeshComponent, Gameplay Volume, etc, are\nreferred to as \"Active Targets\" in the Manager. External code provides and updates\nthe set of Active Targets, eg for example tracking the active Actor Selection in the Editor.\n\nFor a given Target, a tuple (Selector, Selection, SelectionEditor) is created and maintained.\nThe FGeometrySelection is ultimately a basic list of integers and does not have any knowledge\nof what it is a selection *of*, and is not intended to be directly edited. Instead the\nSelectionEditor provides that functionality. This separation allows \"selection editing\" to\nbe customized, eg to enforce invariants or constraints that might apply to certain kinds of selections.\n\nThe IGeometrySelector provides the core implementation of what \"selection\" means for a given\nTarget, eg like a mesh Component, or mesh object like a UDynamicMesh. The Selector is\ncreated by a registered Factory, allowing client code to provide custom implementations for\ndifferent Target Types. Updates to the Selection are done via the Selector, as well as queries\nabout (eg) renderable selection geometry. 3D Transforms are also applied via the Selector,\nas only it has the knowledge about what can be transformed and how it can be applied.\n\nThe GeometrySelectionManager provides high-level interfaces for this system, for example\nexternal code (eg such as something that creates a Gizmo for the active selection) only\nneeds to interact with SelectionManager, calling functions like\n::BeginTransformation() / ::UpdateTransformation() / ::EndTransformation().\nThe SelectionManager also handles Transactions/FChanges for the active Targets and Selections.",
