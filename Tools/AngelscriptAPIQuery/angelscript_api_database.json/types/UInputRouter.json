Sets of InputBehaviors are\nregistered, and then PostInputEvent() is called for each event.\n\nInternally one of the active Behaviors may \"capture\" the event stream.\nSeparate \"Left\" and \"Right\" captures are supported, which means that (eg)\nan independent capture can be tracked for each VR controller.\n\nIf the input device supports \"hover\",  PostHoverInputEvent() will forward\nhover events to InputBehaviors that also support it.",
