# UBspConversionTool

**继承自**: `UInteractiveTool`

Converts BSP brushes to static meshes.

Known limitations:
- Preview does not respond to property changes in the brush detail panel while the tool is running. User would need
  to create some event that does change the preview (such as tool property change, or selection change).
- BSP brushes with non-manifold geometry (specifically, the stair brushes) cannot be used with the "Convert, then combine"
  path because boolean operations do not allow them. The user gets properly notified of this if it comes up.
