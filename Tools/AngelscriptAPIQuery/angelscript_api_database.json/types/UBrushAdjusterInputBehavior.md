# UBrushAdjusterInputBehavior

**继承自**: `UAnyButtonInputBehavior`

A behavior that captures a keyboard hotkey to enter a sub-mode "bAdjustingBrush" while the key is pressed.
The target tool must call OnDragStart() and OnDragUpdate() to feed the screen coordinates of the mouse for the duration
of the behavior. And use "GetIsBrushBeingAdjusted" to pause/disable the brush motion while it is being adjusted.

OnDragStart() defines the starting location of an adjustment
OnDragUpdate() adjusts the brush strength and radius based on the magnitude of the screen coordinate delta in the
vertical and horizontal directions respectively.
