# UPlayerStateCountLimiterConfig

**继承自**: `UNetObjectCountLimiterConfig`

If one wishes to use the NetObjectCountLimiter prioritizer for PlayerStates
this class makes it possible to have specific settings for PlayerStates in
case other classes also wish to use said prioritizer.
Only available if running with Iris replication.
The PlayerState will look for a prioritizer aptly named PlayerState and
set that prioritizer for it. It could be any kind of prioritizer but
if the NetObjectCountLimiter is used this config will come in handy.
