This class provides two ways of usage:\n- Polling mode: accessible through ForEachActorInWorld.\n- Subscriber mode: this mode is enabled through acquire/release semantics. When acquired, the actor tracker\nsubscribes to the world's PostRegisterAllActorComponents and PreUnregisterAllActorComponentsRegistered events\ntracking all unique actors. In addition, metrics implementing IWorldMetricsActorTrackerSubscriber receive actor\naddition and removal notifications.",
