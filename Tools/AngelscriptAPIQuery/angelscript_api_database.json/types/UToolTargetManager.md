# UToolTargetManager

**继承自**: `UObject`

The tool target manager converts input objects into tool targets- objects that
can expose various interfaces that tools need to operate on them.

Someday, the tool target manager may implement caching of targets.

See the class comment for UToolTarget for more info.
