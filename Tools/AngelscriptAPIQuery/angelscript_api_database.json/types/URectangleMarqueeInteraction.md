# URectangleMarqueeInteraction

**继承自**: `UObject`

* URectangleMarqueeInteraction is a simplified version of URectangleMarqueeMechanic that is not a UInteractionMechanic,
* which requires a base Tool/ToolManager. This variant does not create it's own InputBehavior, but is still a
* ClickDragBehaviorTarget.
*
* DrawHUD() must be called by the owning code.
