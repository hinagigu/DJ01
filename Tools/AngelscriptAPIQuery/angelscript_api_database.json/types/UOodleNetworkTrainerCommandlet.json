If\n                    omitted, all files in the directory are used.\n\n\nSecondary/Testing Commands:\n    - \"Enable\":\n            - Inserts the Oodle PacketHandler into the games packet handler component list, and initializes Oodle *Engine.ini settings\n\n\n    - \"MergePackets OutputFile PacketFile1,PacketFile2,PacketFileN\":\n            - Takes the specified packet capture files, and merges them into a single packet capture file\n\n    - \"MergePackets OutputFile All Directory\":\n            - As above, but merges all capture files in the specified directory.\n\n\n    - \"GenerateDictionary OutputFile FilenameFilter Changelist PacketFile1,PacketFile2,PacketFileN\":\n            - Takes the specified packet capture files, with an optional filter for a substring of a filename and changelist filter\n                    (use \"all\" to ignore either of these filters), and uses them to generate a network compression dictionary\n\n    - \"GenerateDictionary OutputFile FilenameFilter Changelist All Directory\":\n            - As above, but uses all capture files in the specified directory, to generate a network compression dictionary\n\n\n    - \"DebugDump OutputDirectory CaptureDirectory Changelist\"\n            - Recursively iterates all .ucap files in CaptureDirectory, and converts them to Oodle-example-code compatible .bin files,\n                    in OutputDirectory\n\n\n@todo #JohnB: Unimplemented commands:\n    - \"PacketInfo PacketFile\":\n            - Outputs information about the packet file, such as the MB amount of data recorded, per net connection channel, and data types\n            - @todo #JohnB: Only implement, if deciding to actually capture/track this kind of data",
