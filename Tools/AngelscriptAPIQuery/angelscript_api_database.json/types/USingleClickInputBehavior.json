  "doc": "USingleClickInputBehavior implements a standard \"button-click\"-style input behavior.\nThe state machine works as follows:\n   1) on input-device-button-press, hit-test the target. If hit, begin capture\n   2) on input-device-button-release, hit-test the target. If hit, call Target::OnClicked(). If not hit, ignore click.\n\nThe second hit-test is required to allow the click to be \"cancelled\" by moving away\nfrom the target. This is standard GUI behavior. You can disable this second hit test\nusing the .HitTestOnRelease property. This is strongly discouraged.\n\nThe hit-test and on-clicked functions are provided by a IClickBehaviorTarget instance.",
