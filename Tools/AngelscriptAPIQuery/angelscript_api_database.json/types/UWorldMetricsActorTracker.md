# UWorldMetricsActorTracker

**继承自**: `UWorldMetricsExtension`

Actor tracker class

This class provides a tracking context for actors added and removed from the world. For an actor to be considered
added to the world, it must have all its components registered. This class provides two ways of usage:
- Polling mode: accessible through ForEachActorInWorld.
- Subscriber mode: this mode is enabled through acquire/release semantics. When acquired, the actor tracker
subscribes to the world's PostRegisterAllActorComponents and PreUnregisterAllActorComponentsRegistered events
tracking all unique actors. In addition, metrics implementing IWorldMetricsActorTrackerSubscriber receive actor
addition and removal notifications.
