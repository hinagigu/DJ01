# URemeshMeshTool

**继承自**: `UMultiSelectionMeshEditingTool`

Simple Mesh Remeshing Tool

Note this is a subclass of UMultiSelectionTool, however we currently only ever apply it to one mesh at a time. The
function URemeshMeshToolBuilder::CanBuildTool will return true only when a single mesh is selected, and the tool will
only be applied to the first mesh in the selection list. The reason we inherit from UMultiSelectionTool is so
that subclasses of this class can work with multiple meshes (see, for example, UProjectToTargetTool.)
