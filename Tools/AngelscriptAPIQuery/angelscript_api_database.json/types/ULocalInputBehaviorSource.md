# ULocalInputBehaviorSource

**继承自**: `UObject`

An implementation of IInputBehaviorSource that forwards to a user provided-lambda, to allow
a tool to supply a behavior source different from the one it is implementing itself. Useful,
for instance, when a tool wants to supply different behaviors to separate input routers.
