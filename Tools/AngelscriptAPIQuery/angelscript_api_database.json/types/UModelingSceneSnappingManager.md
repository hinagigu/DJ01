# UModelingSceneSnappingManager

**继承自**: `USceneSnappingManager`

UModelingSceneSnappingManager is an implementation of snapping suitable for use in
Modeling Tools/Gizmos (and potentially other places).

Currently Supports:
   - snap to position/rotation grid
   - snap to mesh vertex position
   - snap to mesh edge position

Snapping to mesh vertex/edge positions currently works for Volume (BrushComponent), StaticMeshComponent,
and DynamicMeshComponent.

Currently the StaticMesh vertex/edge snapping is dependent on the Physics
system, and may fail or return nonsense results in some cases, due to the physics
complex-collision mesh deviating from the source-model mesh.
