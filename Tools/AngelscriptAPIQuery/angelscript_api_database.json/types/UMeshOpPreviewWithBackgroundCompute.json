  "doc": "UMeshOpPreviewWithBackgroundCompute is an infrastructure object that implements a common UI\npattern in interactive 3D tools, where we want to run an expensive computation on a mesh that\nis based on user-specified parameters, and show a preview of the result. The expensive computation\n(a MeshOperator) must run in a background thread so as to not block the UI. If the user\nchanges parameters while the Operator is running, it should be canceled and restarted.\nWhen it completes, the Preview will be updated. When the user is happy, the current Mesh is\nreturned to the owner of this object.\n\nThe MeshOperators are provided by the owner via a IDynamicMeshOperatorFactory implementation.\nThe owner must also Tick() this object regularly to allow the Preview to update when the\nbackground computations complete.\n\nIf an InProgress Material is set (via ConfigureMaterials) then when a background computation\nis active, this material will be used to draw the previous Preview result, to give the\nuser a visual indication that work is happening.",
