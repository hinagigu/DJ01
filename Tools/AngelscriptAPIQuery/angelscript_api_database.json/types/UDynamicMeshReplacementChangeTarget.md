# UDynamicMeshReplacementChangeTarget

**继承自**: `UObject`

Bare bones wrapper of FDynamicMesh3 that supports MeshReplacementChange-based updates.  Shares the mesh ptr with the MeshReplacementChange objects, so it must not be changed directly
TODO: also support other MeshChange objects (by making a copy of the mesh when applying these changes)
