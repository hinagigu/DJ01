# UNetObjectConnectionFilter

**继承自**: `UNetObjectFilter`

The NetObjectConnectionFilter is a dynamic pre-poll filter that supports per connection filtering. It should be seen as an alternative to the ReplicationSystem SetConnectionFilter API for use cases where
for example the object in question can be a dependent object. Dependent objects will override dynamic filtering and only dynamic filtering.
