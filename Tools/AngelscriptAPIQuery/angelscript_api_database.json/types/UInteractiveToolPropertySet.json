Currently any UObject\ncan be added as a property set, however there is no automatic mechanism for those child\nUObjects to notify the Tool when a property changes.\n\nIf you make your property set UObjects subclasses of UInteractiveToolPropertySet, then\nwhen the Tool Properties are changed *in the Editor*, the parent Tool will be automatically notified.\nYou can override UInteractiveTool::OnPropertyModified() to act on these notifications",
