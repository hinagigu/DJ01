# FPerBoneInterpolation

## 属性

### BoneReference
- **类型**: `FBoneReference`

### InterpolationSpeedPerSec
- **类型**: `float32`
- **描述**: If greater than zero, this is the speed at which the sample weights are allowed to change for this specific bone.

A speed of 1 means a sample weight can change from zero to one (or one to zero) in one second.
A speed of 2 means that this would take half a second.

Smaller values mean slower adjustments of the sample weights, and thus more smoothing. However, a
value of zero disables this smoothing entirely.

If set, the value overrides the overall Sample Weight Speed which will no longer affect this bone.

## 方法

### opAssign
```angelscript
FPerBoneInterpolation& opAssign(FPerBoneInterpolation Other)
```
