# UMVVMBlueprintViewExtension

**继承自**: `UObject`

An extension class to define MVVM-related properties and behaviour. When WBP compiled, this information is copied
into UMVVMViewClassExtension. This class provides a hook into the MVVM compiler and partially exposes it for injecting
user-defined behaviour at compile-time.
