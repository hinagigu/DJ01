It creates and maintains the 2D rectangle associated with a mouse drag.\n* It does not test against any scene geometry, nor does it maintain any sort of list of selected objects.\n*\n* You must manually call the Setup(), Render() and DrawHUD() functions.\n* Note these functions have been changed from the Mechanic versions to be easier to call without additional InteractiveTool machinery\n*\n* Attach to the delegates and use the passed rectangle to test against your geometry.\n*\n* TODO: Refactor this into a more generalized / generally usable class in RectangleMarqueeMechanic.h,\n* and share more common code with URectangleMarqueeMechanic.",
