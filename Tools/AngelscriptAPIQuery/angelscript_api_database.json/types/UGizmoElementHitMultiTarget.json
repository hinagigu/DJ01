This implementation is used for\nHitTargets which support hitting multiple parts within a gizmo element hierarchy.\n\nFor a gizmo with multiple parts, the part identifier establishes a correspondence between a gizmo part\nand the elements representing that part within the hit target. The valid part identifiers should\nbe defined in the gizmo. Identifier 0 is reserved for the default ID which should be assigned to\nelements that do not correspond to any gizmo part, such as non-hittable decorative elements.",
