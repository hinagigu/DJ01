# USceneSnappingManager

**继承自**: `UObject`

USceneSnappingManager is intended to be used as a base class for a Snapping implementation
stored in the ContextObjectStore of an InteractiveToolsContext. ITF classes like Tools and Gizmos
can then access this object and run snap queries via the various API functions.

USceneSnappingManager::Find() can be used to look up a registered USceneSnappingManager, if one is available

See UModelingSceneSnappingManager for a sample implementation.
