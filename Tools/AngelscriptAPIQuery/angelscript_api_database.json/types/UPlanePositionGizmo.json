  "doc": "UPlanePositionGizmo implements a gizmo interaction where 2D parameter value is manipulated\nby dragging a point on a 3D plane in space. The 3D position is converted to 2D coordinates\nbased on the tangent axes of the plane.\n\nAs with other base gizmos, this class only implements the interaction. The visual aspect of the\ngizmo, the plane, and the parameter storage are all provided externally.\n\nThe plane is provided by an IGizmoAxisSource. The origin and normal define the plane and then\nthe tangent axes of the source define the coordinate space.\n\nThe interaction target (ie the thing you have to click on to start the dragging interaction) is provided by an IGizmoClickTarget.\n\nThe new 2D parameter value is sent to an IGizmoVec2ParameterSource\n\nInternally a UClickDragInputBehavior is used to handle mouse input, configured in ::Setup()",
