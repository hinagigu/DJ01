# UNetObjectPrioritizer

**继承自**: `UObject`

NetObjectPrioritizers are responsible for determining how important it is to replicate an object. Priorities should be at least 0.0f,
meaning no need to replicate. At 1.0f objects are being considered for replication. Priorities are acumulated per object and connection
until it's replicated, at which point the priority is reset to zero. Bandwidth constraints and other factors may cause a highly prioritized
object to still not be replicated to a particular connection a certain frame. There is no mechanism to force an object to be replicated a
certain frame, but the priority is a major factor in the decision.
